# What is Climate Change?
Climate change, as we know it, is essentially the **dangerous rise in the average global temperature caused by human activity.**

When people discuss climate change, they often talk about the rise in temperatures since the 1850s (right before the industrial revolution).

That's because the beginning industrial revolution is often considered the 'beginning' of climate change (more on why later). 

Therefore, we use **pre-industrial average temperatures as a baseline for average global temperature.**

# Causes of Climate Change
In short, **human carbon dioxide emissions caused the increase in temperature** since the mid-nineteenth century.

Carbon dioxide is so pivotal because of the greenhouse effect,
a mechanism through which the Earth maintains temperatures that can sustain life.

Let's take a look at how [NASA describes this phenomenon](https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/19/what-is-the-greenhouse-effect/){:target="_blank"}:
```
The greenhouse effect is the way in which heat is trapped close to the surface of the Earth by "greenhouse gases." These heat-trapping gases can be thought of as a blanket wrapped around the Earth, which keeps it toastier than it would be without them. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides.
```

The greenhouse effect makes Earth habitable;
however, **the problem is that humans have tampered with the amount of greenhouse gases (specifically CO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere.**

Typically, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is managed through a phenomena called
[the carbon cycle](https://www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle){:target="_blank"}.

But the industrial revolution brought with it the use of fossil fuels for energy.
Humans burned fossil fuels to power machines, releasing carbon dioxide in the process.

Since the 1850s, this practice has only become more widespread. Today, fossil fuel use is the largest cause of greenhouse gas emissions.

While all of the emitted greenhouse gasses play a part in global temperature, the biggest culprit is carbon dioxide.
Let's look at how the [Global Carbon Project]("/") puts it:
```
CO₂ is the single most important greenhouse gas leading to human-induced climate change. Although other GHGs are more powerful per molecule in warming the planet than CO₂, the sheer amount of CO₂ emissions from human activities and the fact that some of the emissions stay in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years, makes CO₂ the biggest challenge in combating climate change.
```

And it's true, **carbon dioxide makes up a majority of human greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.**
[According to the EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases){:target="_blank"},
CO<sub>2</sub> accounted for 80% of global human GHG emissions in 2019.

Humans have known about the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> on the climate has been known for nearly two centuries.
In 1856, Eunice Foote published her "Circumstances Affecting the Heat of Sun's Rays" in the *American Journal of Art and Science*.

She found that carbon dioxide absorbed and maintained more heat from sunlight than any of the other gasses she measured.

Moreover, historical data shows us the correlationship between atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and global average temperatures.

As we can see in the following graph, the rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has driven the increase in global average temperature
from pre-industrial levels.

The above graph is from the U.S. Global Change Research Program's report: 
[*Climate Change Impacts in the United States: The Third National Climate Assessment*](https://www.globalchange.gov/browse/multimedia/global-temperature-and-carbon-dioxide)

CO<sub>2</sub> is particularly problematic because it persists in the atmosphere for a really long time.
So, even if humans stop all their carbon dioxide emissions, past emissions will continue to cause temperature increase.

While past emissions alone cannot cause us to cross the threshold for dangerous warming, humans have gotten 
increasingly close to the danger line over time(1.5 degree celsius warming above pre-industrial levels).
If we cannot contain our greenhouse gas emissions, we could reach a point of no return for climate change as early as 2030.

You can read more about the situation today in [another article]("/"), and the [action](/action/)
and [policy](/policy/) sections address exactly how we can 'solve' climate change.
