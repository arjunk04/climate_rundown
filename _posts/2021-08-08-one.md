# Climate Change 101
Climate change, as we know it, is essentially the **dangerous rise in the average global temperature caused by human activity.**

When people discuss climate change, they often talk about the rise in temperatures since the 1850s (right before the industrial revolution).

That's because the beginning industrial revolution is often considered the 'beginning' of climate change (more on why later). 

Therefore, we use **pre-industrial average temperatures as a baseline for average global temperature.**

# Causes of Climate Change
In short, **human carbon dioxide emissions caused the increase in temperature** since the mid-nineteenth century.

Carbon dioxide is so pivotal because of the greenhouse effect,
a mechanism through which the Earth maintains temperatures that can sustain life.

Let's take a look at how [NASA describes this phenomenon](https://climate.nasa.gov/faq/19/what-is-the-greenhouse-effect/){:target="_blank"}:
```
The greenhouse effect is the way in which heat is trapped close to the surface of the Earth by "greenhouse gases." These heat-trapping
gases can be thought of as a blanket wrapped around the Earth, which keeps it toastier than it would be without them. Greenhouse gases
include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides.

The greenhouse effect makes Earth habitable;
however, **the problem is that humans have tampered with the amount of greenhouse gases (specifically CO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere.**

Typically, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is managed through a phenomena called
[`the carbon cycle`](https://www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/CarbonCycle){:target="_blank"}.

But the industrial brought with it the use of fossil fuels for energy.
Humans burned fossil fuels to power machines, releasing carbon dioxide in the process.

Since the 1850s, this practice has only become more widespread. Today, fossil fuel use is the largest cause of greenhouse gas emissions.

While all of these greenhouse gasses cause increases in global temperature, the biggest culprit is carbon dioxide.
Let's look at how the [Global Carbon Project]("/") puts it:
```
CO₂ is the single most important greenhouse gas leading to human-induced climate change. Although other GHGs are more powerful per 
molecule in warming the planet than CO₂, the sheer amount of CO₂ emissions from human activities and the fact that some of the emissions
stay in the atmosphere for hundreds to thousands of years, makes CO₂ the biggest challenge in combating climate change.
```

And it's true, **carbon dioxide makes up a majority of human greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.**
[According to the EPA](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases){:target="_blank"},
CO<sub>2</sub> accounted for 80% of global human GHG emissions in 2019.

Humans have known about the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> on the climate has been known for nearly two centuries.
In 1856, Eunice Foote published her "Circumstances Affecting the Heat of Sun's Rays" in the *American Journal of Art and Science*.

She found that carbon dioxide (which she called carbonic acid gas) absorbed and maintained more heat from the Sun's
rays than any of the other gasses she measured.

Moreover, historical data shows us the correlationship between atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and global average temperatures.

As we can see in the following graph, the rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> has driven the increase in global average temperature
from pre-industrial levels.

***TODO: Create my own graph***

The above graph is from the U.S. Global Change Research Program's report: 
[*Climate Change Impacts in the United States: The Third National Climate Assessment*](https://www.globalchange.gov/browse/multimedia/global-temperature-and-carbon-dioxide)

CO<sub>2</sub> is particularly problematic because it persists in the atmosphere for a really long time.
So, even if humans stop all their carbon dioxide emissions, past emissions will continue to cause temperature increase.

*You can read more about the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> on the planet in another article.*

***TODO: link***

Fortunately, there is still hope. The United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that past emissions will likely cause 
no more than 1.2 degree celsius warming since pre-industrial times. The threshold for dangerous warming is 1.5 degrees celsius, so we still have
some time.

That said, the situation is still dire. If we cannot contain our greenhouse gas emissions, we could reach a point of no return for climate change by 2030.

You can read more about the situation today in another article, and the [action](/action/)
and [policy](/policy/) sections address exactly how we can 'solve' climate change.
