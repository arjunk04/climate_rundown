# The Situation Today
In the previous article, we looked at the basics of climate change.
We learned about how greenhouse gasses, especially carbon dioxide, influence the Earth's temperature.

So, where are we today in terms of preventing the most dangerous effects of climate change?

The threshold for dangerous warming is widely considered to be 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures (more on this in another article).

We have crept closer and closer to this danger line over time, with no sign of slowing down. To analyze what we need to do to slow down the rise in 
global average temperatures, we must analyze the situation today. We can get a good sense of where we are today by answering these questions:
1. How much carbon dioxide have we already emitted?
1. What are carbon emissions like today?

# Past Emissions
The good news is that past emissions alone cannot result in warming crossing this 1.5 degree threshold.

Take a look at this quote from the United Nations' "Global Warming of 1.5 ºC" special report: 
```
Past emissions alone are unlikely to raise global-mean temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels (medium confidence), but past emissions do commit to other changes, such as further sea level rise (high confidence).
```

Essentially, carbon dioxide coninues to warms the Earth for decades after it's emission into the atmosphere. So, what this report from the UN
is telling us is that the carbon that we have already put into the atmosphere will warm the planet further and cause some effects like a rise in sea levels;
however, it *will not push us past the 1.5°C extreme danger line for climate change*.

Now, to understand how
CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions have changed over time, look at this graph from Our World in Data:

As we can see, carbon dioxide emissions start to accelerate after 1850, likely because of increased fossil fuel after the industrial revolution. 
We can see this correlation through this graph on Fossil Fuel Use (once again provided by Our World in Data):

As we can see, carbon dioxide emissions have increased more and more since the industrial revolution. At first glance, this seems to be due to increasing use of 
fossil fuels as an energy source. That said, we'll look more into what causes these emissions (both in the past and in the modern day) in another article.

Now that we understand the history of
CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions, we can start to look at the situation today.

# Current Emissions
Since our main goal is to reduce emissions everywhere, a good first step is to find out which countries have the highest
CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions. 

Let's take a look at this graph of carbon emissions across the globe in 2019:

We can see carbon dioxide emission data visualized differently in this graph of 2017 carbon emission data:

As we can see, 27% of the carbon dioxide emitted worldwide comes from China; however, this number may be deceptive, since China is the most populous country 
in the world. Since a greater population leads to more emissions, we can analyze countries better if we look at their
CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions per person.

Here's a graph of carbon emissions per capita across the globe:

As we can see, China has lower per capita emissions than the United States, despite having more emissions overall.

Analyzing both overall and per capita emissions is incredibly important when looking at which countries manage carbon emissions the best.

Now that we have a better sense of carbon emissions today, we can start to think about why emissions are so high and how we can reduce them. 

# Summary
Make no mistake, the situation today *is* dire. However, it's far from hopeless. Nothing is set in stone yet, but our time may run out soon.

Thinking about the situation today and how much time we have left is really stressful, but we have to understand the situation today so that we can
understand how we go forward from here. We'll be going into this more in future articles, but if there's one thing you should take away from this article, 
it's that we still have time to fix the situation today.
