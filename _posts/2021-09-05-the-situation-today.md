# The Situation Today
In the previous article, we looked at the basics of climate change.
We learned about how greenhouse gasses, especially carbon dioxide, influence the Earth's temperature.

So, where are we today in terms of preventing the most dangerous effects of climate change?

The threshold for dangerous warming is widely considered to be 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures (more on this in another article).

We have crept closer and closer to this danger line over time, with no sign of slowing down. To analyze what we need to do to slow down the rise in 
global average temperatures, we must analyze the situation today. We can get a good sense of where we are today by answering these four questions:
1. Past Emissions
1. Current Emissions
1. COVID and Climate Change Today

***!!! TODO: Put this into questions !!!***

# Past Emissions
The good news is that past emissions alone cannot result in warming crossing this 1.5 degree threshold.

Take a look at this quote from the United Nations' "Global Warming of 1.5 ºC" special report: 
```
Past emissions alone are unlikely to raise global-mean temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels (medium confidence), but past emissions do commit to other changes, such as further sea level rise (high confidence).
```

Now, to understand how CO
<sub>2</sub> 
emissions have changed over time, look at this graph from Our World in Data:

As we can see, carbon dioxide emissions start to accelerate after 1850, likely because of increased fossil fuel after the industrial revolution. 
We can see this correlation through this graph on Fossil Fuel Use (once again provided by Our World in Data):

As we can see, carbon dioxide emissions have increased more and more since the industrial revolution. At first glance, this seems to be due to increasing use of 
fossil fuels as an energy source. That said, we'll look more into what causes these emissions (both in the past and in the modern day) in another article.

Now that we understand the history of CO
<sub>2</sub>
emissions, we can start to look at the situation today.
