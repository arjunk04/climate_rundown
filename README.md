# Climate Rundown

This is a project by me to provide easily accessible and understandable resources for the climate crisis.
Currently, this website is very much a work-in-progress.

For every article, I research a variety of resources that an interested reader can look into. 
The articles may be oversimplified at times since the goal is for this website to be an easy read and a discussion starter.


This website is built on github pages and jekyll. 

I used the jekyll theme texture, forked from [this repo](https://github.com/samarsault/texture).
